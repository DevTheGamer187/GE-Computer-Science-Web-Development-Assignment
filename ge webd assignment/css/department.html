                Welcome to the Department of Mathematics, Kirori Mal College (KMC), University of Delhi, Delhi. It is one of the best mathematics departments in the University of Delhi. The mathematics department of KMC has 18 permanent faculty members, and an intake capacity of 83 students who are admitted in the department every year through Common University Entrance Test - Undergraduate (CUET-UG). The department has a separate airconditioned staff room, equipped with computing, printing and Wi-Fi facilities for its faculty members. It has an active Mathematics society called "TENSORS" which organizes mathematical fests every year. Besides, the society regularly organizes "Qazi-Zameeruddin" seminars in which eminent mathematicians from India and abroad are invited to give lectures, provide insight into various facets of mathematics and talk to students about their future career prospects in mathematics. The college library has a very rich and large collection of reference books in mathematics for the benefit of its students. Last but not the least, the faculty of the mathematics department is very committed to the cause of teaching mathematics to its students and helping them to achieve their best in the academic life at the college.</article>

                        <summary>Real Analysis</summary>
                        <p class="detailpara">Real analysis is an area of analysis that studies concepts such as sequences and their limits, continuity, differentiation, integration and sequences of functions. By definition, real analysis focuses on the real numbers, often including positive and negative infinity to form the extended real line.</p>

                    <summary>Discrete Mathematics</summary>
                    <p class="detailpara">Discrete mathematics is the study of mathematical structures that can be considered "discrete" rather than "continuous". Objects studied in discrete mathematics include integers, graphs, and statements in logic.</p>

                        <summary>Riemann Integration</summary>
                        <p class="detailpara">In the branch of mathematics known as real analysis, the Riemann integral, created by Bernhard Riemann, was the first rigorous definition of the integral of a function on an interval. It was presented to the faculty at the University of GÃ¶ttingen in 1854, but not published in a journal until 1868.</p>

                        <summary>Numerical Analysis</summary>
                        <p class="detailpara">Numerical analysis is a branch of mathematics that solves continuous problems using numeric approximation. It involves designing methods that give approximate but accurate numeric solutions, which is useful in cases where the exact solution is impossible or prohibitively expensive to calculate.</p>

                        <summary>Group Theory</summary>
                        <p class="detailpara">In abstract algebra, group theory studies the algebraic structures known as groups. The concept of a group is central to abstract algebra: other well-known algebraic structures, such as rings, fields, and vector spaces, can all be seen as groups endowed with additional operations and axioms.</p>

                        <p class="detailpara">Abstract algebra is the branch of algebra dealing with the study of algebraic systems or structures with one or more mathematical operations associated with elements with an identifiable pattern, differing from the usual number systems.</p>

                        <summary>Multivariate Calculus</summary>
                        <p class="detailpara">Multivariable calculus is the extension of calculus in one variable to calculus with functions of several variables: the differentiation and integration of functions involving multiple variables, rather than just one. Multivariable calculus may be thought of as an elementary part of advanced calculus.</p>

                        <p class="detailpara">In mathematics, an ordinary differential equation is a differential equation dependent on only a single independent variable. As with other DE, its unknown consists of one function and involves the derivatives of those functions.</p>
